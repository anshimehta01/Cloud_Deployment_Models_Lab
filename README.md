🌩️ Cloud Deployment Lab

Welcome to my Cloud Deployment Lab repository! 🚀 This project is a collection of hands-on experiments where I explored the power of the cloud by combining database operations, AWS services, and server deployment. From building and modifying tables to running queries and deleting them, I started with the basics of data handling. Then, I stepped into the cloud world by creating EC2 launch templates, setting up Auto Scaling groups, and watching new instances spin up automatically when needed—like magic! ✨ Finally, I deployed a full LAMP stack server, tested it, secured it, and even enhanced it with phpMyAdmin for convenience. This lab reflects my journey of learning how to make applications scalable, reliable, and cloud-ready, blending both theory and practice into real-world cloud solutions. 🌍☁️
